# Python File Handling Project

This is a simple file handling project in Python that demonstrates how to perform basic operations on files using the `pathlib` and `os` modules.

It allows you to:
- Create files
- Read files
- Update files (rename, overwrite, or append)
- Delete files

   - Displays file content in the console.  

3. Update File  
   - Rename an existing file.

   - Append new text to an existing file.  

4. Delete File  
   - Delete an existing file permanently.  

5. File Explorer  
   - Shows all files and folders in the project directory using `rglob('*')`.
